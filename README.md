# DuckDuckGo Proxy Explorer

This is a web interface that allows you to explore and test the DuckDuckGo API through a proxy. It provides an easy and intuitive way to perform searches and view DuckDuckGo API results.

## Note on Free Hosting

Please note that both the frontend and backend services are hosted on free tiers (Vercel and Render, respectively). The backend API may take a few moments to start up when accessed after a period of inactivity, as the service is suspended during idle times to conserve resources. If you experience a timeout on your first search, please wait a moment and try again.
